I want to build a new life. I am 48 years old – will be 49 in a week. I just left an abusive husband and moved across the country to live with family while I figure out what to do next…but one thing I had already determined is that being a Software Engineer adds to my skillset in such a way that I can lead technical teams as a Project Manager. I am a Certified Scrum Master and have led many cross-functional teams but felt at a disadvantage not being able to help team members with their code.  Additionally, I want the flexibility of picking up side-gigs when I need or want extra money, or simply working in software development remotely if I choose. 

It’s the choices. The autonomy. The construction of a new identity. I’m at a stage in my life where I work hard but know there is more to life and want the ability to take a vacation, visit my kids or work from wherever I want – if I want to. Frankly, I also want to get paid what I’m worth. I’m tired of getting paid less than others because I don’t have the technical skills…so this will help fix that.

I’m on my own. For the first time in my life I only really have me to worry about. Both of my kids are adults now and pretty much crushing life…they still need me but not in the all-day-every-day sense…I got married to their father (not abusive) when I was barely 20 – and after that most of my choices were based on a “we”. That marriage ended very amicably but I started a new relationship (probably too quickly) and all my decisions there were based on a “we”. Plus, we had a business together…so work AND life were based on “we” – plus I was still raising children…not a lot of room for “me”.

So now it’s all about me – whether I like it or not. Sometimes it’s lonely. Sometimes it’s amazing. Every day is terrifying. 

There have been days when this program saved my emotional life because it gave me something to concentrate on – to focus on – to be hopeful about. I don’t participate much in the groups…I’ve been diagnosed with c-ptsd and I’m pretty scared of people at the moment – but I’m determined to change that. I don’t think I have much to offer conversations – but I’m determined to change that too.

I’ve been told for years I don’t create value and I am a burden…I didn’t think I believed that but now that I sometimes write questions or replies in Slack…and then delete them…I see that perhaps I do, on some level, believe that.  

I like being able to tell people I meet that I’m studying to be a software engineer…I like starting to create my own identity. For so long my identity has been “wife of…”, “someone’s mom”, “business partner of …”. Now I get to just be ME. And I’m proud that includes becoming a Software Engineer.
